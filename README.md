- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dickson Garcia
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learn and evolve as a and developer 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a backend with Python and Django

Experience with Python and Django. I have worked on projects using databases such as MongoDB and PostgreSQL, and implemented solutions using Docker, FastAPI, and AWS.

In my last job, I was responsible for building and maintaining an AI content generation application. I used Django and MongoDB to develop the application, and managed the entire project lifecycle from conceptualization to launch.

In my free time, I keep up to date with the latest trends and technologies in my field through readings and online courses. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.

If you are looking for a solid back end developer with experience in Python and Django, feel free to contact me. I am confident that I can add value to your company or project.
